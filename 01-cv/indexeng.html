            <p>During my university years, I was involved in things that were interesting to me, such as sports and information security. At first, I wrote bat viruses that could destroy all the data on someone else's computer, because antiviruses do not respond to this format. I started studying Trojan viruses, and for fun and "sporting" interest I sent a virus glued with a cryptor to a regular picture to my classmates. I enjoyed climbing through the personal files of unsuspecting friends. 
                I discovered the link sniffer - I found out the IP of my friends and what device and web browser they were using to access the Internet. It was incredibly interesting to steal cookies, connect to webcams, and have remote access to another person's computer, and I did it without bad motives, because it was a completely different world that was very interesting to me.
                With the help of PHP Devel Studio, I created fake applications (entrance to the tank world launcher, Vkontakte mini application) that looked very similar to the original application, linked it all to the site's sniffer. As a result, he received passwords and emails that were entered into the appropriate fields of this fake "application". I was able to take over other people's social media pages because I could convince them why they should download this program and use it.
                I used to make DoS attacks on websites using Python and more.
                A GPS tracker or an FM radio microphone planted on my best friend made me feel happy and laugh, because now I knew where he was going and what he was saying at a short distance from me. But later I realized that there are professionals who use this kind of "fun" to do illegal and harmful things. My family also had many encounters with such criminals who stole or fraudulently took possession of my family's money.  That's why I went to the cybersecurity faculty, because they teach you how to protect your personal data and avoid becoming a victim of cybercriminals.
                I want to join the cyber army, because I have a goal to improve my skills and be useful in the civil service.
            I speak Ukrainian, Russian and English at the B1 level, and I have been trained for the B2 First (FCE) certificate, which will not be difficult for me to obtain. 
During my contract service, as an instructor of a group of dog handlers, I have repeatedly won first place in competitions among my border guard detachment. I am motivated to serve, because I want to grow in my career and get a military rank. 
I intend to continue my studies after obtaining a second higher education to acquire new skills and knowledge. 
            Sincerely, Senior Sergeant Shyrobokov Heorhii. </p>
